# YakTUNE
## What's it do?
This program will open a tune saved in a .csv format which is simpler and easier to manage. It then converts that into a .PDTS file to be opened and loaded using the DSC Tuning Software.


## How to use
1. Change parameters in a properly formatted (yourtune).csv file.
2. Run the YakTUNE.exe program.
3. Navigate to and select (yourtune).csv to open.
4. Change the name and folder is desired and save as a .PDTS file
5. Open this newly created .PDTS file in DSC Tuning software.
6. **Confirm the values of the tables.** *Currently an error is shown for Velocity Table 2, but it appears this loads correctly. A message box is supplied with the values to confirm*
7. Edit the tune further, or write to the controller using DSC Tuning software.
